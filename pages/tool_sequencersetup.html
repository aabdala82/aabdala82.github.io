    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This tool is a full Unreal Engine C++ Plugin. The UI is 100% done with the Slate framework. It automates the process of recreating cinematic sequences from any DCC package into Unreal Engine's Sequencer, neatly organizing all imported assets and level sequence shots. It streamlines the workflow by transferring camera and character animations, and other static elements directly into the engine, significantly reducing manual setup time.</p>
